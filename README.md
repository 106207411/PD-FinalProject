# Advanced 2048
Implementation of advanced 2048 game using C++ SFML.
It is a game where you have to combine tiles with the same number to get the 2048 tile. Apart from the original 2048 game, there are some additional features: chance, destiny, and obstacle tiles. Chance tiles multiply each tile value by 2. Destiny tiles may randomly multiply each tile value by 1/2, 4, or clear all the tiles. Obstacle tiles prevent you from moving in a specific direction.
You can choose the theme (classic 2048, schools, and cats) in the settings menu.
